Before we start 
    - Next phase schedule
    - The next three weeks

1.1 Introduction to phase 2

    - Group work is key to Success 

1.2 Why do we need to learn javascript?

    HTML - Set the webpage structure
    CSS - styles the webpage 
    JS - controls the reaction based on the the user's action

    Uses of JS
        - Adds interactivity to the webpage
        - Retrieves data from the webpage that is entered by the user

        - Brings data from the database and display it on the webpage (Node.js)
        - Serves a webpage from a servers (Node.js)

        - Makes a webpage faster and robust through a library (React.js)

1.3 Definition of javascript:
    - a language to develop interactive web pages

    - Interactive website
        - responds/reacts to the user/client according their action.

1.4 Definition of javascript a programming language to instruct our computer

    Computer language

        - are language that are used to communication with a computer.

        - It is divided in to 3

            1. Machine language (Low level language)
                - is a collection of 0 and 1 (binary)
                - computers only understand machine language

                i.e - 111001 00101011 1010

            2. Assembly language
                - uses mnemonic (abbreviation for an operation) codes
                    - Example of mnemonic codes
                        Add -> addition
                        Sub -> subtraction
                        Mul -> multiply

                    - i.e Add 111001 1010

            3. Programming language (High level language)
                - A set of rules that are used to instruct a computer to perform specific tasks

                - Understand by human
                    - Example of High level language
                        - javascript
                        - C
                        - C++
                        - Java 
                        - Python
                    
                    - i.e 57 - 10


    How does programming language instructs computers?
        - It instructs it through machine language

        - Programming language ---> Translator program ---> Machine language

    what are translator program 
        - Converts programs that are written in human readable format into machine understand format 

        - There are 3 types of translator programs (converter)

            1. Assembler
                - Assembly language <-----> Assembler <----> Machine language

            2. Interpreter
                - High level language <----> Interpreter <-----> Machine language

                - It translates and executes the program line by line 

                - Example of interpreted language
                    - Python, javascript, Ruby, Php perl

            3. Compiler
                - High level language <-----> Compiler -----> Machine language

                i.e 45 + 14 ----> Compiler -----> 111001 00101011 1010

                - It translates the whole program at once, and it generates the object code along while a list of errors
